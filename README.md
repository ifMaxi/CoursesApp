# Courses App

Small project created with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

This app is part of the "Android Basics - Compose" course of the "Build a grid" codelab using the Card element as the heart of the app.

The idea of this project was to create a small app using a scrollable list in this case using LazyVerticalGrid.
